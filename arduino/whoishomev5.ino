//the Arduino Script and walk through and setup of the home lab was done by : Dylan Poll
//https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-poll-4a324a1a2/
//this was part of the who is home project. It used a pi to check mac addresses of devices on the network
//to light up leds be color, the project used the mac addresses of cell phones to see who was home.
//https://github.com/dylanpoll/WhoIsHome
// I used the FastLED libraries demo-reel as a foundation for this, please check out the fastLED github!!
